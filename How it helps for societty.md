# Smart-blind-stick
An innovative solution for visually challenged people 

This smart blind stick is an innovative electronic aid for the visually impaired.
It is designed to enhance user mobility and ensure safer navigation.
At its core, an ultrasonic sensor actively scans the user's path for obstacles.
The sensor works by emitting sound waves and measuring their return time.
When an object is detected within a close range (e.g., 30 cm), it triggers an alarm.
The user is instantly alerted through a clear, audible buzz from a piezo buzzer.
An integrated LED also provides a visual signal for sighted people nearby.
This real-time feedback helps the user to stop or change direction promptly.
Built on an Arduino platform, it's a cost-effective and adaptable solution.
Ultimately, it empowers users with greater confidence and independence.
